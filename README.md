## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- BEM 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create an overlay with the over effect, It was very funny ðŸ˜Š

```css
.image__container {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: var(--Cyan);
    border-radius: .75em;
    transition: .5s ease;
}

.card__img {
    border-radius: .5em;
}

.card__img--view {
    width: 3em;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    text-align: center;
    display: none;
}

.card__img:hover {
    opacity: 0.5;
    cursor: pointer;
}
 
.image__container:hover .img__card--overlay  + .card__img--view {
    display: block;
}    
```

I've been practicing BEM methodology, if you have feedback, you're welcome


### Continued development

I want to do more of those cards with overlay effect becouse I thougth it was cool.
And I want to improve on my BEM metodologhy becouse I'm not sure IÂ´m doing it right

IÂ´m going to start to use SASS in next projects
